        'As promised, here is the long form article on this topic - authored by me.\n\nLong form article:\nChief Executives will increasingly become Chief Navigators too, as exponential or emerging technologies will reshape the world. Having competitors or disruptions are not new for businesses or leaders, however, it is going to become more frequent and intense. So, what are some of the leadership skills we need to consciously build?\n \nThe key pillars to running the business in the digital world - Strategy, People, Technology, Data, and Business models - are going to be there. On top of these, this article outlines, a few capabilities that are not covered most often. \n1. Human-Centered Technologist:\n  \nEvery company’s core could possibly be tech-driven. So, understanding the technology, its human users, cith* (all life forms) users \u0026amp; acith* (non-life forms) ingredients is going to be critical. [*Samskritham / Sanskrit words]. There are many tech giants who have gone to reach sky-high valuations but fail to understand the addictiveness of their tech. When companies care for their users’ well-being, including mental health, won’t that add more stickiness?\n\nWeighing the results of every action and assessing how it affects (positively or negatively) everyone. What can be the remedial actions for those who are negatively affected? In the past, when scientists spoke about the negative effects of leaded petrol, those in power discounted those voices. The same was the case with X-Rays (to check even one’s shoe fitting X-Ray was used) and only after decades regulations followed.\n \nSo, leaders and companies should not wait for the regulations but they need to show ‘humaneness’ and self-regulate. Of course, they need to take risks too without that progress won’t happen.\n  \n2. Asymmetrical Risk Taker:\n  \nThe world and the events in it are complex, respecting them as they are is a good starting point. The leaders who are risk-takers even when they are asymmetric, \u0026amp; own the consequences (especially negative outcomes) will be highly rewarded rather than interventionists or risk-transferors. \n  \nThe world is in awe when players and leaders take crucial decisions, deliver a win and make it look easy. While this is good for movies, if these qualities are not coded then how will companies \u0026amp; managers replicate the decisions (in the same context)? \n  \n3. Codifier of Knowledge \u0026amp; Decision-Making Process:\n  \nBoth successes and failures should be codified so that the successors can learn and act accordingly. Is it going to be easy with more technology or going to be tougher? With shorter tenure for employees, many of them gig workers, and CxO tenures even shorter, how is this knowledge coding going to work? Organically or inorganically?\n  \nUntil positronic brains become mainstream and we can transfer knowledge instantaneously - we need to work on coding.\n  \nAlso, we may mature in the future with robots shadowing executives, learning their habits, and helping other humans to replicate their behaviors. Will leaders be open to such shadowing and help companies keep the entry barriers high?\n  \n4. Architect of the Company’s Moat:\n  \nA competitive differentiator can be erased in a few hours with new technology. Example: GenAI or Quantum Computing. Assessing a company’s moat should be a daily routine just like analyzing the daily balance sheet. This is one of the key pillars of staying relevant to the customers and stakeholders.\n  \nRelevance includes not only the value provided but also assessing threats to the business \u0026amp; its users (their data etc.). Tech infusion into business should be for the people and centered around humans \u0026amp; earthlings.\n  \n5. Recharger of Energy:\n  \nWhatever the leaders used to assess every few years - their business model or USPs - they will be forced to do it more frequently. Everyone is going to get tired and deplete their mental, emotional, and physical energy. Finding answers will get more difficult with every progressive day. Where do you conserve or find your reserve energy?\n  \nGoing beyond employees, leaders should look at all stakeholders (including users), show care and meet quarterly or annual stock market expectations!  Of course, numbers are hard realities and one can’t get away with alternate realities. Can they? Should they?\n    \n6. Champion of Thought Experiments \u0026amp; Embracing Alternate Realities:\n  \nAccording to the father of Quantum Computing, Deutsch, it will be crucial to embrace ‘Many Worlds Interpretation’ as proposed by Everett III (1957). Consequently, alternate realities too for every event. We will reach a situation in the future, where like in the movies, we could be discussing shaping the realities not just the narratives - solving a puzzle in a fine-grained matrix of realities (Taleb).\n  \nThe ability to draw lessons from the extremes, including sci-fi, will shape the strategies.Example: Marketing in a Martian community. Customer experience for humanoids. Will the product work without electricity?\n  \nThese out-there-somewhere thought experiments need to be embraced as well, for the purpose of keeping the business dynamic! \n  \n7. The Driver of Purposefulness:\n  \nMany of today’s and even immediate future problems, might have an easy or instantaneous solution. Thanks to the evolution of technology. As the tech gets more accessible for everyday life, it is likely to increase automation and reduce even opportunities to use our grey cells as the systems could pre-emptively address them. It is like having a bored Sherlock Holmes (in billions).\n  \nAlso, learning through ‘pathemata mathemata’ (guiding your learning through pain) will get difficult as most of the pain or resistance to learning could be eased out. Are humans ready for such a process or will they ever be?\n  \nTo conclude, when emerging technologies are going to be democratized, every human/company will have access to it, so, retooling the core tech / proprietary tech will become imperative. This will open up more questions, like: will open source tech stay relevant? Will companies be willing to file a patent?\n  \nHow should leaders think and act in the exponential tech era?\n',

Shouldn\u0026#39;t technology be driven by leadership, rather than the other way around...?\n\nPerhaps some of this has to do with the difference between management and leadership, which are often conflated. Management is doing things correctly, and leadership is doing the correct things. Leadership is about situational awareness, strategic vision, and ethics. It’s always been true that leaders need to be aware of the tools and technologies of the times and the impact of those technologies, but real leadership is more about aligning with people, and in general, management is more about aligning with things.  Just read Plato and Sun Tzu, then read Churchill, Patton, Branson, and other more contemporary leaders and you’ll find the same basic themes.\n\n\nFinally, keep this in mind: Technology is evolving at an exponential rate, while people evolve over the course of millennia. A truly good leader can lead regardless of era or technology. \n\n\n\n215:[18,12,14]\n216:[102,104]\n217:[15]\n218:[]\n219:[11]\n21a:[]\n21b:Tad2,',

        ', technology has provided new platforms to rethink how we engage with each other, help society grow and get things done. This requires the ability to constantly learning and imagining a new role for humans, in the context of a highly tech-driven environment. So for me leaders should certainly keep up the pace with tech developments, but keep focusing on leading people. The role of human beings might change, but in the end we remain fairly basic forms of life that need guidance, support, empathy, direction. AI, ML, quantum computing will make us more effective, but we remain the fragile individuals that happen to spend a tiny fraction of time on this beautiful planet.","likes":2,"profile":"$2b1","replies":"$2b5","commentIndex":4,"postId":"64946dd0e1f80b0001ddaa17","postType":7,"upvoters":"$2b6","entityType":"COMMENT","stats":"$2b9"}\n2bc:[]\n2bb:{"id":"6489a7346ea1630001c45d23","title":"CMO","industry":"Services (non-Government)","companySize":"2 - 10 employees","companyName":"","isAnonymous":false,"contributionPoints":0,"pulsePoints":0,"pic":"","displayname":"","email":"","slug":"","country":"","isAmbassador":false,"isVerified":false,"firstname":"","departments":"$20e","isReadOnly":true,"hasDemoAccess":false,"connectionsCount":0,"firstSeen":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","isCustomer":false,"level":5,"primaryFunction":102,"additionalGpiFunctions":"$20f","groupsMembership":"$2bc","hasPeerFinderAccess":false,"isPointsRequired":true,"accessFormRequired":false,"isUserBlocked":false}\n2bf:T187b,',

        'As promised, here is the long form article on this topic - authored by me.\n\nLong form article:\nChief Executives will increasingly become Chief Navigators too, as exponential or emerging technologies will reshape the world. Having competitors or disruptions are not new for businesses or leaders, however, it is going to become more frequent and intense. So, what are some of the leadership skills we need to consciously build?\n \nThe key pillars to running the business in the digital world - Strategy, People, Technology, Data, and Business models - are going to be there. On top of these, this article outlines, a few capabilities that are not covered most often. \n1. Human-Centered Technologist:\n  \nEvery company’s core could possibly be tech-driven. So, understanding the technology, its human users, cith* (all life forms) users \u0026amp; acith* (non-life forms) ingredients is going to be critical. [*Samskritham / Sanskrit words]. There are many tech giants who have gone to reach sky-high valuations but fail to understand the addictiveness of their tech. When companies care for their users’ well-being, including mental health, won’t that add more stickiness?\n\nWeighing the results of every action and assessing how it affects (positively or negatively) everyone. What can be the remedial actions for those who are negatively affected? In the past, when scientists spoke about the negative effects of leaded petrol, those in power discounted those voices. The same was the case with X-Rays (to check even one’s shoe fitting X-Ray was used) and only after decades regulations followed.\n \nSo, leaders and companies should not wait for the regulations but they need to show ‘humaneness’ and self-regulate. Of course, they need to take risks too without that progress won’t happen.\n  \n2. Asymmetrical Risk Taker:\n  \nThe world and the events in it are complex, respecting them as they are is a good starting point. The leaders who are risk-takers even when they are asymmetric, \u0026amp; own the consequences (especially negative outcomes) will be highly rewarded rather than interventionists or risk-transferors. \n  \nThe world is in awe when players and leaders take crucial decisions, deliver a win and make it look easy. While this is good for movies, if these qualities are not coded then how will companies \u0026amp; managers replicate the decisions (in the same context)? \n  \n3. Codifier of Knowledge \u0026amp; Decision-Making Process:\n  \nBoth successes and failures should be codified so that the successors can learn and act accordingly. Is it going to be easy with more technology or going to be tougher? With shorter tenure for employees, many of them gig workers, and CxO tenures even shorter, how is this knowledge coding going to work? Organically or inorganically?\n  \nUntil positronic brains become mainstream and we can transfer knowledge instantaneously - we need to work on coding.\n  \nAlso, we may mature in the future with robots shadowing executives, learning their habits, and helping other humans to replicate their behaviors. Will leaders be open to such shadowing and help companies keep the entry barriers high?\n  \n4. Architect of the Company’s Moat:\n  \nA competitive differentiator can be erased in a few hours with new technology. Example: GenAI or Quantum Computing. Assessing a company’s moat should be a daily routine just like analyzing the daily balance sheet. This is one of the key pillars of staying relevant to the customers and stakeholders.\n  \nRelevance includes not only the value provided but also assessing threats to the business \u0026amp; its users (their data etc.). Tech infusion into business should be for the people and centered around humans \u0026amp; earthlings.\n  \n5. Recharger of Energy:\n  \nWhatever the leaders used to assess every few years - their business model or USPs - they will be forced to do it more frequently. Everyone is going to get tired and deplete their mental, emotional, and physical energy. Finding answers will get more difficult with every progressive day. Where do you conserve or find your reserve energy?\n  \nGoing beyond employees, leaders should look at all stakeholders (including users), show care and meet quarterly or annual stock market expectations!  Of course, numbers are hard realities and one can’t get away with alternate realities. Can they? Should they?\n    \n6. Champion of Thought Experiments \u0026amp; Embracing Alternate Realities:\n  \nAccording to the father of Quantum Computing, Deutsch, it will be crucial to embrace ‘Many Worlds Interpretation’ as proposed by Everett III (1957). Consequently, alternate realities too for every event. We will reach a situation in the future, where like in the movies, we could be discussing shaping the realities not just the narratives - solving a puzzle in a fine-grained matrix of realities (Taleb).\n  \nThe ability to draw lessons from the extremes, including sci-fi, will shape the strategies.Example: Marketing in a Martian community. Customer experience for humanoids. Will the product work without electricity?\n  \nThese out-there-somewhere thought experiments need to be embraced as well, for the purpose of keeping the business dynamic! \n  \n7. The Driver of Purposefulness:\n  \nMany of today’s and even immediate future problems, might have an easy or instantaneous solution. Thanks to the evolution of technology. As the tech gets more accessible for everyday life, it is likely to increase automation and reduce even opportunities to use our grey cells as the systems could pre-emptively address them. It is like having a bored Sherlock Holmes (in billions).\n  \nAlso, learning through ‘pathemata mathemata’ (guiding your learning through pain) will get difficult as most of the pain or resistance to learning could be eased out. Are humans ready for such a process or will they ever be?\n  \nTo conclude, when emerging technologies are going to be democratized, every human/company will have access to it, so, retooling the core tech / proprietary tech will become imperative. This will open up more questions, like: will open source tech stay relevant? Will companies be willing to file a patent?\n  \nHow should leaders think and act in the exponential tech era?\n',

        'Well ... If you ask the question of ChatGPT one of the answers which you could get back is ....\n\n\nIn an era of exponential technology and AI innovation, leaders need to possess certain fundamental capabilities to navigate the rapidly changing landscape and effectively harness the potential of these advancements. Here are some essential leadership capabilities for this context:\n\n\n1. Technological Literacy: Leaders must have a solid understanding of emerging technologies, such as artificial intelligence, machine learning, robotics, and automation. They should stay updated with the latest trends, developments, and potential applications of these technologies. This literacy enables leaders to make informed decisions, drive innovation, and effectively communicate with technical experts.\n\n\n2. Adaptability and Agility: The pace of technological change demands leaders who can adapt quickly to new circumstances, embrace uncertainty, and lead with agility. They need to be open to learning, flexible in their thinking, and comfortable with experimentation. Embracing change and encouraging a culture of continuous learning and adaptation is crucial.\n\n\n3. Strategic Vision: Leaders need to develop a clear and compelling vision for their organizations in the context of exponential technology and AI innovation. They should be able to anticipate future trends, identify new opportunities, and set strategic directions that leverage these technologies to drive growth and competitive advantage.\n\n\n4. Ethical and Human-Centric Mindset: As technology continues to advance, leaders must prioritize ethical considerations and ensure that AI and other technologies are developed and deployed in a manner that aligns with human values and societal well-being. They should be committed to responsible innovation, addressing potential biases, privacy concerns, and the impact on jobs and society.\n\n\n5. Collaboration and Team Building: Effective leaders understand the importance of collaboration and cross-functional teamwork. They foster an environment where diverse perspectives are valued, encourage interdisciplinary collaboration, and build teams that can work effectively with emerging technologies. Collaboration with external partners, such as startups, research institutions, and industry networks, also becomes crucial for accessing expertise and driving innovation.\n\n\n6. Continuous Learning and Reskilling: Leaders must prioritize their own continuous learning and reskilling to keep up with the evolving landscape. They should encourage and support ongoing learning opportunities for their teams, enabling them to acquire new skills and competencies required in an era of AI and exponential technology. Lifelong learning becomes essential for leaders and their organizations to remain competitive.\n\n\n7. Change Management and Transformation: The advent of AI and exponential technology often requires significant organizational change and transformation. Leaders must have strong change management capabilities to guide their teams through these transitions. They should be adept at inspiring and motivating employees, managing resistance to change, and creating a culture that embraces innovation and digital transformation.\n\n\n8. Emotional Intelligence: As technology takes on more routine tasks, leaders need to focus on developing their emotional intelligence (EQ). EQ skills, such as empathy, self-awareness, and effective communication, become critical in leading diverse teams and fostering collaboration. Leaders who can understand and empathize with the impact of technology on individuals and address concerns will be more successful.\n\n\n9. Risk Management: With the introduction of new technologies, leaders must be adept at assessing and managing risks effectively. They should be able to navigate the ethical, legal, and security challenges associated with AI and exponential technology. Balancing innovation with risk mitigation strategies becomes crucial to ensure responsible and sustainable deployment.\n\n\nThese fundamental leadership capabilities can empower leaders to navigate the complex and dynamic landscape of exponential technology and AI innovation, seize opportunities, and drive positive impact within their organizations and beyond.',

It sounds as if people are expecting leaders to change because of technology. Shouldn\u0026#39;t technology be driven by leadership, rather than the other way around...?\n\nPerhaps some of this has to do with the difference between management and leadership, which are often conflated. Management is doing things correctly, and leadership is doing the correct things. Leadership is about situational awareness, strategic vision, and ethics. It’s always been true that leaders need to be aware of the tools and technologies of the times and the impact of those technologies, but real leadership is more about aligning with people, and in general, management is more about aligning with things.  Just read Plato and Sun Tzu, then read Churchill, Patton, Branson, and other more contemporary leaders and you’ll find the same basic themes.\n\n\nFinally, keep this in mind: Technology is evolving at an exponential rate, while people evolve over the course of millenn',

        'For me those organisations that are using the EXO2 methods are making strides in sustainable growth with the 6 D\u0026#39;s.  \nDigitisation: This refers to the process of converting analog information into digital format. It allows for easier storage, manipulation, and distribution of data. For example, the digitisation of music transformed the industry from physical CDs to digital streaming platforms like Spotify.\n\n\nDeception: Deception occurs when exponential technologies are in their early stages and may not seem significant or disruptive. However, their impact grows exponentially over time. An example of deception is the early stages of electric vehicles, which were initially seen as inferior to traditional gasoline-powered cars but are now becoming more popular and disruptive.\n\n\nDisruption: Disruption happens when exponential technologies reach a tipping point and fundamentally change an industry or market. Examples include the disruption of the taxi industry by ride-sharing platforms like Uber, or the disruption of the hotel industry by Airbnb.\n\n\nDemonetisation: Demonetisation refers to the reduction or elimination of the cost of goods and services due to exponential technologies. This can make products or services more accessible and affordable. For instance, the cost of genome sequencing has dramatically decreased over time, enabling personalized medicine and healthcare.\n\n\nDematerialisation: Dematerialisation is the process of replacing physical products with digital or virtual alternatives. This allows for greater efficiency and reduces resource consumption. An example is the dematerialization of books into e-books, reducing the need for physical paper and printing.\n\n\nDemocratisation: Democratisation involves making resources, knowledge, and opportunities accessible to a broader audience. This allows for greater participation and empowerment. Examples include the democratization of education through online platforms like Khan Academy, or the democratisation of finance through crowdfunding platforms like Kickstarter.',

        'In an era of exponential technology and AI innovation, there are several fundamental leadership capabilities that are crucial for success. These capabilities differ from previous leadership styles due to the unique demands and complexities associated with these advancements. Here is a comparison between leadership styles from the past, present, and future stages:\n\n1. Past Leadership Style:\n   - Command and Control: In the past, leadership style often emphasized hierarchical decision-making and a top-down approach. Leaders were expected to possess technical expertise and provide clear instructions to subordinates.\n\n2. Present Leadership Style:\n   - Collaborative and Adaptive: In the present, leadership style has shifted towards collaboration and adaptability. Leaders recognize the importance of engaging employees, fostering teamwork, and being responsive to change.\n\n3. Future Leadership Style:\n   - Visionary and Tech-Savvy: In the future, leadership style will need to embrace a visionary mindset and be grounded in technological expertise. Effective leaders will be required to understand the potential of exponential technologies and AI innovation and strategically leverage them for organizational success.\n\nKey Leadership Capabilities for the Future:\n\n1. Technological Literacy: Leaders must develop a deep understanding of emerging technologies such as AI, machine learning, robotics, and blockchain. This literacy enables them to identify opportunities and make informed decisions regarding their organization\u0026#39;s technological investments.\n\n2. Continuous Learning: With technology advancing rapidly, leaders must be committed to ongoing learning and development. This includes staying updated on the latest industry trends, attending conferences, and engaging in continuous education programs.\n\n3. Adaptability: Future leaders must be agile and adaptable, capable of responding swiftly to disruptions and changing market dynamics. They should be comfortable with uncertainty and be able to inspire their teams to embrace change.\n\n4. Ethical Decision-Making: As AI and technology play an increasingly significant role, leaders must prioritize ethical decision-making. They should establish ethical guidelines, promote transparency, and ensure responsible AI usage within their organizations.\n\n5. Visionary Thinking: Leaders must possess a clear vision and a forward-thinking mindset. They should be able to communicate a compelling narrative and inspire their teams toward a shared future direction.\n\n6. Collaboration and Empathy: Building collaborative and empathetic relationships with team members, stakeholders, and customers will remain crucial. Future leaders must foster a culture of inclusivity, open communication, and empathy to maintain high levels of employee engagement.\n\nOverall, future leadership in the era of exponential technology and AI innovation requires a unique blend of technological expertise, adaptability, ethical decision-making, visionary thinking, collaboration, and empathy. Successful leaders will be those who can navigate the complexities of rapid technological advancements and inspire their teams to leverage these advancements for growth and innovation.',

This top-down approach centralizes authority and control in the hands of the leader.\n\n🟩 Quick decision-making\n🟩 Clear direction\n\n🟥 Stifles creativity\n🟥 Demotivates team members\n\n➡️ Best for: Crisis situations and Urgent tasks.\n\n\n2️⃣ Authoritative Leadership \nThe leader sets a clear vision and direction for the team, inspiring and motivating team members to achieve set goals.\n\n🟩 Motivational\n🟩 Promote collaboration\n\n🟥 Can be overbearing\n\n➡️ Best for: Driving change and New projects launch.\n\n\n3️⃣ Pacesetting Leadership \nThe leader sets high performance standards and expects the team to meet these benchmarks, often leading by example.\n\n🟩 Drives high performance\n\n🟥 Can burn out the team\n\n➡️ Best for: High-performing teams and Short-term goals.\n\n\n4️⃣ Democratic Leadership\nThe leader involves team members in the decision-making process, fostering a participative approach to leadership.\n\n🟩 Inclusive\n🟩 Builds consensus\n\n🟥 Slow decision-making\n🟥 May lead to conflict\n\n➡️ Best for: Creative teams and Complex problems.\n\n\n5️⃣ Coaching Leadership\nThe leader focuses on developing individual team members\' skills and potential, providing guidance and feedback for personal growth.\n\n🟩 Improves individual performance\n🟩 Long-term growth\n\n🟥 Time-consuming\n🟥 Requires a skilled leader\n\n➡️ Best for: High-potential teams and Long-term development.\n\n\n6️⃣ Affiliative Leadership\nThe leader prioritizes creating harmony and building strong emotional bonds among team members.\n\n🟩 Creates a positive work environment\n🟩 Boosts morale\n\n🟥 May avoid conflict\n🟥 Lack of direction\n\n➡️ Best for: Healing rifts and Boosting team spirit.\n\n\n8️⃣ Laissez-faire Leadership\nThe leader provides minimal direction and allows team members to self-manage and make their own decisions.\n\n🟩 High autonomy\n🟩 Promote innovation / creativity\n\n🟥 Can lead to disorganization\n🟥 Lack of accountability\n\n➡️ Best for: Highly skilled, self-motivated teams and teams that require little supervision and thrive on autonomy.\n\n\n💡A leader knows when to change their approach; leadership is dynamic and varies according to the context and objectives, or the circumstances. \nThis is the most important message I want to leave you with and I learned to myself.\n\n\n\n\n',
